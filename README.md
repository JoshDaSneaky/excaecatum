# Excaecatum

# What is this:
This is my first attemt at making a game in python after my first trimester of my university degree. I want to learn more and practice my coding by creating something I am interested in. 

I encourage any critique on my code, I dont want to build any bad habits or bad practices early on so i am open to all input!

# Why "Excaecatum"
Since python is obviously mostly run in a command line, which typically doesnt have a GUI, i wanted to make a game that doesnt require much "visual" gameplay.

"Excaecatum" is latin for "the blinded", i hope for this game to be a game where the player is blind in some aspect, or what im leaning towards right now, in a situation which requires there eyes to be closed for a large portion of the game
